# COMPAS-Recidivism
Explore predictors of recidivism on the Broward County population 

Our analysis seeks to 
1. Construct an RAI for predicting two-year recidivism on the Broward County population
2. Construct an RAI for predicting two-year violent recidivism on the Broward County population
3. Determine whether each RAI is equally predictive across race, age, and gender
4. Compare the performance of our RAIs to COMPAS
